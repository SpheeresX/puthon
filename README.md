# puthon
PHP but it's Python.

## What?

Instead of writing php code, you use Python. Anything that you `print()` will be displayed on the website. **You should not use this for production applications. I created this as a joke.**

## Usage

1. install nodejs and python3
2. put all of your .py files in `bin/`
3. `node server.js`
4. go to 127.0.0.1:8080
5. profit?

## Why?

I want to die
